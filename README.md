# Project-Review-Management-System
Did this project in 5th semester of BE under DBMS subject 

In project review management system we have two main files we worked on. The database itself and making the front end ui for it.

Database file has been provided as PRMS.backup file. Please make sure database is properly restored from this backup file in order to use this application. Make sure the database is also named as PRMS only while using this app.

We have used postgres pgadmin 3 database and C# to complete this project, it is recommended that you use the same while tring this application out. 

the exe file to run the app can be found at Project-Review-Management-System/ProjectReviewManagementSystem/ProjectReviewManagementSystem/bin/Debug
